\section{Segment intersection}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{seg_intersection}
Here is presented a basic segment intersection function.
It is based on the method presented here: \url{http://paulbourke.net/geometry/pointlineplane/}.
The function works of 1-cells in $d=2$.
The function can return 0, 1 or 2 intersection points. Two intersection points are
returned only if both the cells are colinear and the second cell is contained in the first one.
Each intersection is stored in a \texttt{Tuple\{Float64,Verts\}} where 
the \texttt{Float64} is the parameter of the intersection and the \texttt{Verts} 
is the approximate point of intersection.

\section{Segment fragmentation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{seg_fragmentation}
This function returns the new vertices and cells created by the intersection of 
the \texttt{to\_inters} edge with the \texttt{intersectable} edges.
\texttt{alphas} and \texttt{vertsnum} are variables used through all the function.
%######################%
@D Segment fragmentation
@{function seg_fragmentation(
    V::Verts, EV::Cells, 
    to_inters::Cell, intersectable::Cells
)
    alphas = Dict{Float64, Int64}()
    vertsnum = size(V, 1)

    @< Compute the intersections @>
    @< Add new cells to EV @>
    
    retV, retEV
end
@}
For each cell in \texttt{intersectable} are computed the intersections with \texttt{to\_inters} via 
the \hyperref[seg_intersection]{\texttt{seg\_intersection}} function. The intersection points are
stored in \texttt{V} and \texttt{retV} then the parameters are coupled to the index of the newly 
computed vertices into the \texttt{alphas} dictionary.
%##########################%
@D Compute the intersections
@{retV = Verts(0, size(V, 2))
for cell in 1:size(intersectable, 1)
    inters = seg_intersection(V, to_inters, intersectable[cell, :])
    while !isempty(inters)
        alpha, point = pop!(inters)
        V = vcat(V, point)
        retV = vcat(retV, point)
        alphas[alpha] = size(V,1)
    end
end
@}
We sort and iterate over the key set of \texttt{alphas}
to fill a newly generated \texttt{retEV} matrix. As previously stated, \texttt{alphas} maps 
the parameters of the intersections to the indices of the new vertices, so the sorting of the keys 
is important to create coherent and consecutive cells.
%####################%
@D Add new cells to EV
@{alphaskeys = sort(collect(keys(alphas)))
alphasnum = length(alphaskeys)

nvertsnum = size(V, 1)
retEV = spzeros(Int8, alphasnum+1, nvertsnum)
for a in 1:alphasnum
    if a == 1
        retEV[1, to_inters.nzind[1]] = 1
        retEV[1, alphas[alphaskeys[a]]] = 1
    end
    if a == alphasnum
        retEV[alphasnum+1, alphas[alphaskeys[a]]] = 1
        retEV[alphasnum+1, to_inters.nzind[2]] = 1
    else
        retEV[a+1, alphas[alphaskeys[a]]] = 1
        retEV[a+1, alphas[alphaskeys[a+1]]] = 1
    end
end
@}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Planar Arrangement}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Given \texttt{sigma} 1-skeleton flattened on the $x_3=0$ plane and the intersections with $x_3=0$ of the 2-cells
that can intersect \texttt{sigma}, the function returns \texttt{sigma} fully fragmented.
%###################%
@D Planar Arrangement
@{function planar_arrangement(
    Vsigma::Verts, EVsigma::Cells, 
    Vinters::Verts, EVinters::Cells
)
    @< Merge data matrices @>
    @< Build return matrices @>
    @< Fragment cells @>
    @< Delete marked cells @>

    retV, retEV
end
@}
We firstly need to merge the input data. We concatenate the vertices lists in \texttt{V} and 
we build a big \texttt{EV} matrix to store both \texttt{EVsigma} and \texttt{EVinters}:
\[
    \texttt{EV} = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \begin{array}{c|c}
            \texttt{EVsigma} & 0 \\ 
            \hline
            0 & \texttt{EVinters}
        \end{array}
    \end{bmatrix}
\]
%####################%
@D Merge data matrices
@{EVs_size = size(EVsigma)
EVi_size = size(EVinters)
cellsnum = EVs_size[1] + EVi_size[1]
V = vcat(Vsigma, Vinters)
EV = spzeros(Int8, cellsnum, EVs_size[2] + EVi_size[2])
EV[1:EVs_size[1], 1:EVs_size[2]] = EVsigma
EV[EVs_size[1]+1:end, EVs_size[2]+1:end] = EVinters
@}
Now we build the \texttt{retEV} and \texttt{retV} matrices that will store 
the data of the fragmentation. \texttt{retEV} initially contains only the cells 
of the 1-skeleton of \texttt{sigma} because the only original 1-cells that the 
result should contain are the ones from \texttt{sigma} which have no intersections 
with other cells.
%######################%
@D Build return matrices
@{overtsnum = size(V, 1)  # original vertices number
ocellsnum = EVs_size[1]  # original cells number
retEV = hcat(EVsigma[:, :], spzeros(Int8, ocellsnum, overtsnum-EVs_size[2]))

retV = V[:, :]
@}
For each 1-cell we compute its fragmentation with the \hyperref[seg_fragmentation]{\texttt{seg\_fragmentation}} 
function and we push the data into the \texttt{retEV}(adding columns and rows) and \texttt{retV} matrices.
While we iterate the cells we store into \texttt{todelete} the cells of \texttt{sigma} which 
intersect with cells outside \texttt{sigma}.
%###############%
@D Fragment cells
@{todelete = Array{Int64, 1}()
for i in 1:cellsnum

    cells = vcat(EV[1:i-1, :], EV[i+1:end, :])
    nV, nEV = seg_fragmentation(V, EV, EV[i,:], cells)

    if size(nV,1) != 0
        ncellsnum = size(nEV, 1) # new cells number
        nvertsnum = size(nEV-overtsnum, 2) # new vertices number

        origvs_EV = nEV[:, 1:overtsnum]
        origvs_EV = hcat(
            origvs_EV,
            spzeros(Int8, ncellsnum, size(retV,1)-overtsnum)
        )
        
        retEV = vcat(retEV, origvs_EV)

        nvs_EV = nEV[:, overtsnum+1:end]
        nvs_EV = vcat(
            spzeros(Int8, size(retEV,1)-ncellsnum, size(nvs_EV, 2)),
            nvs_EV
        )

        retEV = hcat(retEV, nvs_EV)
        
        retV = vcat(retV, nV)

        if i <= ocellsnum
            push!(todelete, i)
        end
    end
end
@}
We finally delete the cells marked to be deleted into the \texttt{todelete} stack.
%####################%
@D Delete marked cells
@{while !isempty(todelete) 
    i = pop!(todelete)
    retEV = vcat(retEV[1:i-1, :], retEV[i+1:end, :])
end
@}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Vertices merge}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We import the \texttt{NearestNeighbors.jl} package that provides a good implementation of
the \texttt{KDTree} data structure. 
(\url{https://github.com/KristofferC/NearestNeighbors.jl}).
%####################%
@D Imports and aliases

@D Vertices merge
@{function merge_vertices(V::Verts, EV::Cells, e=10^-10.)
    kdtree = KDTree(V')
    tocheck = collect(size(V,1):-1:1)
    todelete = Array{Int64, 1}()
    @< Iterate over tocheck @>
    @< Delete vertices in todelete @>
    V,EV
end
@}
We create two stacks: \texttt{tocheck} which contains the indices of the vertices
to check and \texttt{todelete} that stores the indices of the vertices to delete later.
Into \texttt{tocheck} we put all the vertices of the complex in reverse order, because
this way we can pop from the stack the indices in order. So, until \texttt{tocheck} is not empty,
we pop a vertex \texttt{vi} from the stack and for each coincident vertex \texttt{vj}, we put it 
into the \texttt{todelete} stack and we sum the columns of \texttt{EV} that points to \texttt{vi} and \texttt{vj}
%#####################%
@D Iterate over tocheck 
@{while !isempty(tocheck)
    vi = pop!(tocheck)
    if !(vi in todelete)
        nearvs = inrange(kdtree, V[vi, :], e)
        for vj in nearvs
            if vj != vi
                push!(todelete, vj)
                EV[:,vi] = EV[:, vi] + EV[:, vj]
            end
        end
    end
end
@}
At last we simply delete the vertices from the \texttt{V} and their 
corresponding columns of \texttt{EV}.
%############################%
@D Delete vertices in todelete
@{while !isempty(todelete)
    vi = pop!(todelete)
    EV = hcat(EV[:, 1:vi-1], EV[:, vi+1:end])
    V = vcat(V[1:vi-1, :], V[vi+1:end, :])
end
@}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Maximal biconnected components}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
To individuate the maximal biconnected components of the fragmented and merged 1-skeleton
we use the well know 1973 Hopcroft-Tarjan algorithm for biconnected components (\url{doi.acm.org/10.1145/362248.362272}).
%#######################%
@D Biconnected components
@{function biconnected_components(V::Verts, EV::Cells)
    @< Declare local variables @>
    @< Support functions @>
    @< Depth first visit @>
    bicon_comps
end
@}
We will need a point stack (\texttt{ps}), an edge stack (\texttt{es}), a list of traversed edges (\texttt{todel}), 
a list of biconnected components (\texttt{bicon\_comps}) and a index to avoid duplicate numbering of vertices (\texttt{hivtx}).
\texttt{ps} is made of triples composed by the index of the vertex in \texttt{V}, the index assigned by the algorithm 
and the component identifier also assigned by the algorithm. \texttt{es} instead contains couples with the index of 
the edge inside \texttt{EV} and the assigned index of the tail node. The indexes in \texttt{todel} and \texttt{bicon\_comps}
are relative to \texttt{EV}.
%########################%
@D Declare local variables
@{ps = Array{Tuple{Int, Int, Int}, 1}()
es = Array{Tuple{Int, Int}, 1}()
todel = Array{Int, 1}()
bicon_comps = Array{Array{Int, 1}, 1}()
hivtx = 1
@}
Here are implemented some functions helpful throughout the algorithm.
\texttt{an\_edge} returns the index relative to \texttt{EV} of the first edge out of \texttt{point} if exists or \texttt{false} otherwise.
\texttt{get\_head}, given an \texttt{edge} and a point (the \texttt{tail}), returns the index relative 
to \texttt{V} of the head (the point that is not \texttt{tail}) of the \texttt{edge}. 
\texttt{v\_to\_vi}, given the index relative to \texttt{V} of a vertex(\texttt{v}), returns its index using the algorithm numbering.
This index can also not exists; in this case \texttt{false} is returned.
