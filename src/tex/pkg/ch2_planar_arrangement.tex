\chapter{Planar Arrangement}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Overview}
Here we present the planar arrangement algorithm. It takes the 1-skeleton of the $\sigma$ face and returns complex made of 2-cells.
It puts \texttt{EVsigma} and \texttt{EVints} together into \texttt{EV} and then fragments every edge in \texttt{EV}. 
When the fragmentation is done, coincident vertices are merged into one and useless edges are deleted. At last,
2-cells are build and the result is returned.

\section{Edge fragmentation}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++%
\subsection{Support functions}
%--------------------------------%
\subsubsection{Edge fragmentation}
\label{sec:frag_edge}
The edge fragmentation is performed by using a function called \texttt{frag\_edge}.
It fragments the edge of index \texttt{edgenum} into \texttt{EV} computing the intersections of
it with the other edges into \texttt{EV}. It returns the updated vertices list \texttt{V} and an 
\texttt{EV} matrix that contains the freshly computed edges.
For every edge in \texttt{EV}, it needs to check if \texttt{edge}(the edge of index \texttt{edgenum} into 
\texttt{EV}) intersects with it. This is done through \texttt{intersect\_edges} (see \ref{sec:intersect_edges}); 
this function takes two edges and returns a list of the intersections of the first edge with the second one; 
every entry of this list is a tuple made of the intersection point and a normalized intersection parameter. 
When there is an intersection, the new point is be pushed into the \texttt{V} matrix while the parameter 
is stored into the \texttt{alphas} dictionary as a key coupled to the new point index.
When every possible intersection is found, the keys in \texttt{alphas} are sorted and, on the base of that,
a new \texttt{EV} is computed.
@D Planar arrangement support functions
@{function frag_edge(V::Verts, EV::Cells, edgenum::Int)
    alphas = Dict{Float64, Int}()
    edge = EV[edgenum, :]
    for i in 1:size(EV, 1)
        if i != edgenum
            intersection = intersect_edges(V, edge, EV[i, :])
            for (point, alpha) in intersection
                V = [V; point]
                alphas[alpha] = size(V, 1)
            end
        end
    end

    alphas[0.0], alphas[1.0] = edge.nzind

    alphas_keys = sort(collect(keys(alphas)))
    cells_num = length(alphas_keys)-1
    verts_num = size(V, 1)
    EV = spzeros(Int8, cells_num, verts_num)

    for i in 1:cells_num
        EV[i, alphas[alphas_keys[i]]] = 1
        EV[i, alphas[alphas_keys[i+1]]] = 1
    end

    V, EV
end

%--------------------------------%
\subsubsection{Edge intersections}
\label{sec:intersect_edges}
We used the method presented by Bourke\cite{bourke} to calculate
the intersection of two edges. Particular attention is needed on the case of colinear edges: it can happen
that \texttt{edge2} is contained into the bounds of the colinear \texttt{edge1}; in this case, both points of
\texttt{edge2} are to be considered intersection and hence must be returned. Because of this, 
the intersections are returned as a list than can contain from zero to two elements; 
each element is a couple \texttt{\{Verts, Float64\}} which represent the intersection
point and a parameter that is useful for sorting the fragmentation points of an edge.
@D Planar arrangement support functions
@{function intersect_edges(V::Verts, edge1::Cell, edge2::Cell)
    x1, y1, x2, y2 = vcat(map(c->V[c, :], edge1.nzind)...)
    x3, y3, x4, y4 = vcat(map(c->V[c, :], edge2.nzind)...)
    ret = Array{Tuple{Verts, Float64}, 1}()
    denom = (y4-y3)*(x2-x1) - (x4-x3)*(y2-y1)
    a = ((x4-x3)*(y1-y3) - (y4-y3)*(x1-x3)) / denom
    b = ((x2-x1)*(y1-y3) - (y2-y1)*(x1-x3)) / denom
    
    if 0 < a < 1 && 0 < b < 1
        p = [(x1 + a*(x2-x1))  (y1 + a*(y2-y1))]
        push!(ret, (p, a))
    elseif isnan(a) && isnan(b) 
        @< Handle colinear edges @>
    end
    return ret
end
@}

If the $\langle$ Handle colinear edges $\rangle$ macro is run, we are sure that the four vertices of 
\texttt{edge1} and \texttt{edge2} are colinear. So, to find if \texttt{edge2} has one or both of 
its vertices inside \texttt{edge1} we follow this procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item We parametrize \texttt{edge1}:
\[
    p = p_1 + \alpha(p_2-p_1), \quad\alpha\in[0, 1]
\]
Where $p_1$ and $p_2$ are the vertices of \texttt{edge1}
\item We solve for $\alpha$:
\begin{gather*}
    o = p_1, \quad\vec{v} = p_2 - p_1 \\
    p = o + \alpha\vec{v} \\
    p - o = \alpha\vec{v} \\
    \vec{v}^\top\cdot(p-o) = \alpha (\vec{v}^\top\cdot\vec{v}) \\
    \alpha = \frac{\vec{v}^\top\cdot(p-o)}{\vec{v}^\top\cdot\vec{v}}
\end{gather*}
\item We replace $p$ of the last equation with both the vertices of \texttt{edge2}.
If the result is $\in[0,1]$ then an intersection is found.
\end{enumerate} 
@D Handle colinear edges
@{o = [x1 y1] 
v = [x2 y2] - o
alpha = 1/dot(v,v')
ps = [x3 y3; x4 y4]
for i in 1:2
    a = alpha*dot(v',(reshape(ps[i, :], 1, 2)-o))
    if 0 < a < 1
        push!(ret, (ps[i:i, :], a))
    end
end
@}
%+++++++++++++++++++++++++%
\subsection{Implementation}
When we need to fragment an \texttt{edge} we use the \texttt{frag\_edge} function (see \ref{sec:frag_edge}) 
and we simply update \texttt{V} and push the small \texttt{ev} matrix into a list of cells called \texttt{EVs}.
We also keep the number of cells into \texttt{finalcells\_num} to build \texttt{EV} with ease.
@D Fragment edge
@{V, ev = frag_edge(V, EV, i)
finalcells_num += size(ev, 1)
push!(EVs, ev)
@}
We declare \texttt{EVs} and \texttt{finalcells\_num} as local variables of \texttt{planar\_arrangement}.
@D Local variables
@{EVs = Array{Cells, 1}()
finalcells_num = 0
@}
So now we have a \texttt{V} that contains the original points with the points computed with the fragmentation
and \texttt{EVs}, a list of edges matrices. We must now put the entries of this list together to form an unique
\texttt{EV} matrix. The process is not immediate because every entry of the list has columns relative to the 
number of vertices in \texttt{V} at the moment of the computation.
@D Put fragmentation results together
@{EV = spzeros(Int8, finalcells_num, size(V,1))
newcell_index = 1
for ev in EVs
    s = size(ev)
    EV[newcell_index:newcell_index+s[1]-1, 1:s[2]] = ev
    newcell_index += s[1]

\section{Coincident vertices merge}
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++%
\subsection{Support function}
\label{sec:merge_vertices}
The merge of coincident is done in the \texttt{merge\_vertices}
function. This relies on the \texttt{NearestNeighbors.jl} package\cite{NearestNeighbors}
which provides a reliable implementation of the \texttt{KDTree} data structure.
@D Imports and aliases
@{using NearestNeighbors
@}
@D Planar arrangement support functions
@{function merge_vertices(V::Verts, EV::Cells, err=1e-10)
    kdtree = KDTree(V')
    tocheck = collect(size(V,1):-1:1)
    todelete = Array{Int64, 1}()
    @< Iterate over tocheck @>
    @< Delete vertices in todelete @>
    @< Delete superfluous cells @>
    V,EV
end
@}
We create two stacks: \texttt{tocheck} which contains the indices of the vertices
to check and \texttt{todelete} that stores the indices of the vertices to delete later.
Into \texttt{tocheck} we put all the vertices of the complex in reverse order (in
this way we can pop from the stack the indices in crescent order). So, until \texttt{tocheck} is not empty,
we pop a vertex \texttt{vi} from the stack and for each coincident vertex \texttt{vj}, we put it 
into the \texttt{todelete} stack and we sum the columns of \texttt{EV} relative to \texttt{vi} and \texttt{vj}
@D Iterate over tocheck 
@{while !isempty(tocheck)
    vi = pop!(tocheck)
    if !(vi in todelete)
        nearvs = inrange(kdtree, V[vi, :], err)
        for vj in nearvs
            if vj != vi
                push!(todelete, vj)
                EV[:,vi] = EV[:, vi] + EV[:, vj]
            end
        end
    end
end
@}
We then calculate the vertices to keep and we filter out
the data relative to the vertices into \texttt{todelete}.
@D Delete vertices in todelete
@{tokeep = setdiff(collect(1:size(V,1)), todelete)
EV = EV[:, tokeep]
V = V[tokeep, :]
@}
At last we delete duplicated, empty and broken edges.
@D Delete superfluous cells
@{tokeep = Array{Int64, 1}()
cells = [Set(EV[i, :].nzind) for i in size(EV,1):-1:1]

    c = pop!(cells)

\section{Maximal biconnected components}
%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++%
\subsection{Support function}
\label{sec:biconnected_components}
To individuate the maximal biconnected components of the fragmented and merged 1-skeleton
we use the well know 1973 Hopcroft-Tarjan algorithm for biconnected components\cite{Hopcroft-Tarjan}.
@D Planar arrangement support functions
@{function biconnected_components(EV::Cells)
    @< Declare local variables @>
    @< DFS utilities @>
    @< Depth first visit @>
    bicon_comps
end
@}
We will need a point stack (\texttt{ps}), an edge stack (\texttt{es}), a list of traversed edges (\texttt{todel}), a list of 
visited points (\texttt{visited}), a list of biconnected components (\texttt{bicon\_comps}) and a index to avoid duplicate 
numbering of vertices (\texttt{hivtx}). \texttt{ps} is made of triples composed by the index of the vertex in \texttt{V}, 
the index assigned by the algorithm and the component identifier also assigned by the algorithm. \texttt{es} instead 
contains couples with the index of the edge inside \texttt{EV} and the assigned index of the tail node. The indexes 
in \texttt{todel} and \texttt{bicon\_comps} are relative to \texttt{EV} while the ones of \texttt{visited} are
relative to \texttt{V}
@D Declare local variables
@{ps = Array{Tuple{Int, Int, Int}, 1}()
es = Array{Tuple{Int, Int}, 1}()
todel = Array{Int, 1}()
visited = Array{Int, 1}()
bicon_comps = Array{Array{Int, 1}, 1}()
hivtx = 1
@}
Here are implemented some functions helpful throughout the algorithm.
\texttt{an\_edge} returns the index relative to \texttt{EV} of the first edge out of \texttt{point} if exists or 
\texttt{false} otherwise. \texttt{get\_head}, given an \texttt{edge} and a point (the \texttt{tail}), returns the 
index relative to \texttt{V} of the head (the point that is not \texttt{tail}) of the \texttt{edge}. 
\texttt{v\_to\_vi}, given the index relative to \texttt{V} of a vertex (\texttt{v}), returns its index using 
the algorithm numbering. This index can also not exists; in this case \texttt{false} is returned.
@D DFS utilities
@{function an_edge(point)
    edges = setdiff(EV[:, point].nzind, todel)
    if length(edges) == 0
        edges = [false]
    end
    edges[1]

        return false
    else
        return ps[i][2]
    end
end

The DFS visit is mostly akin to the one proposed in the Hopcroft-Tarjan original algorithm.
The starting point is the first one in \texttt{V}.

            end
            pop!(ps)
        end
    end
end
@}
To form a biconnected component we pop edges out from the stack of edges (\texttt{es}) until we find the one
of which the index of its tail is equal to the component identifier (called \texttt{LOWPOINT} in the original algorithm) 
of the top point of the point stack (\texttt{ps}). We effectively put inside the \texttt{bicon\_comps} only the components
made of more than one edge because we are interested in building a 1-skeleton of valid 2-cells.

        end
        break
    end
end
@}
When there are no more points to visit in the current connected component we search for a point in \texttt{V}
which has not been visited yet (so a point not listed in the \texttt{visited} array) and we put it on the top
of a new point stack and then let the algorithm iterate again. If there are no more new connected components 
to visit we break the algorithm iteration and exit.

The \texttt{get\_starting\_edge} function returns the first edge
marked with zero. If there are no edges marked with zero, the first edge
marked with one will be returned. If every edge is marked with 2 then $-1$
will be returned.

We define a function to compute the angle between an edge and the 
$x_1$-axis and we apply it to every edge out of every vertex.
The angles relative to a single vertex are then sorted in counterclockwise order.

@D Compute edge angles
@{function edge_angle(v::Int, edge::Cell)
    v2 = setdiff(edge.nzind, [v])[1]
    x, y = V[v2, :] - V[v, :]
    return atan2(y, x)
end

for v in 1:vertsnum
    as = [(e, edge_angle(v, EV[e, :])) for e in EV[:, v].nzind]
    sort!(as, lt=(a,b)->a[2]<b[2])
    as = map(a->a[1], as)
    edge_angles[v] = as
end
@}

The \texttt{next\_edge} function determines the next edge to visit
while building a face. It needs a vertex index (\texttt{v}) and 
an edge index (\texttt{e}) as input.

@D Faces creation utilities
@{function next_edge(v::Int64, e::Int64)
    angles = edge_angles[v]
    ne = findfirst(angles, e)
    while true
        ne += 1
        if ne > length(angles)
            ne = 1
        end
        if edge_markers[angles[ne]] < 2
            break
        end
    end
